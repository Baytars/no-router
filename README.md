Here SoMe is designed to be able to load savages, which, in essense, is in JSON format. I'd like all versions of SoMe capable of reading savages from any previous versions and update on being saved.

The JSON file in `data` folder can be viewed as a blueprint for static langauge version of SoMe, of which data can be more efficient and space saving.
